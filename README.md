# Visualization of Factors of Educational Success

**Run using Processing (p5.js)**

**Description of Functionality:**
- **Filtering:**
  - By clicking on a circle, you can filter by a specific attribute value.
  - By clicking or moving the scroll wheel on the histogram, you can filter by setting a maximum and minimum value.
- **Display:** 
  - After filtering, the size of the circles and histogram bins changes proportionally to the filtered data.
  - Dark color indicates that in the filtered dataset, the proportion of elements for a given attribute value is smaller than in the entire dataset.
  - Light color (red-orange-green) indicates that the proportion is larger.

###### Goal of the project
**Question:** Does sleep have a positive or negative correlation with academic success? Which factor is more significant?
**Answer:** In our dataset, there is no clear connection between the amount of sleep and academic performance. Parental education and access to resources are more significant factors.
